# Unconventional Space

# Introduction
Unconventional Space is a puzzle game that manipulates and warps space. The user will be led through a series of puzzles, each involving some form of illusion. We intend to manipulate the world according to the userâ€™s input in a manner that will attempt to trick the user, but can be comprehended. In addition, we hope to utilize euclidean geometry to develop certain puzzles. 

It is written in C# and developed on Unity. It is developed according to our own design specifications.
